## Changelog
---
 - 21/1/2020: Project repository forked

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c0decrow/netmon-telegram-bot/master/install.sh)"
```

- Nginx and Python required for Easy Install

- Have a JSON file(array of objects) with hostnames, port, alias
  - Example JSON file

 ```json
[
    {
        "url": "www.github.com",
        "port": 443,
        "alias": "GitHub"
    },
    {
        "url": "www.reddit.com",
        "port": 443,
        "alias": "Reddit"
    },
    {
        "url": "www.google.com",
        "port": 80,
        "alias": "Google"
    },
    {
        "url": "www.apple.com",
        "port": 80,
        "alias": null
    }
]
 ```

- Update the python script (variable at the top) with the path/name of your file with hostnames and output file path.(default hostnames= `./hostnames.json   default output= `./index.html`)
- Run `python report.py`
- Ensure that you place the output HTML file in the project directory so it can find its web dependencies
  - Page automcatically reloads every 60 seconds.

## Docker!
---

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 -v ~/path/to/your/hostnames.json:/usr/share/nginx/html/hostnames.json --name monitor circa10a/device-monitor-dashboard
```

**Note: Wait 5 min for cron job to execute and render an index.html**

### Build your own docker image:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/circa10a/Device-Monitor-Dashboard.git
cd Device-Monitor-Dashboard
```

- Edit your hostnames.json file add your website, servers, switches, devices, etc.
```bash
docker build -t myrepo/monitor
docker run --name device-monitor -d -p 80:80 myrepo/monitor
```

```diff
- Known issue: Docker for Mac pings any address and returns success giving false results.
```

## Automation
---
- Setup a web server
- Install a new cron job to run the report periodically `cd $path/to/project_directory/ && python report.py &> /dev/null`
- Set output path in python script to write out html report to web serving directory such as `/var/www/html`
- The page will automatically refresh every 60 seconds to reflect the new report generated by cron
